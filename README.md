# RTTabBarController

Completely custom tab bar controller, intended to be used as replacement for UITabBarController

## Features

* Replaceable tabs, using long-press 
* Scrollable tab items
* Ability to use corner tab items as side-panel triggers
* Ready to customize look and feel, however you want it to be



Note: Requires iOS 8.4 as minimum. No intentions to support older ones. Even if it could possibly be supporting earlier iOS versions, I just don't care about any of them at this point.
